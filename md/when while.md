Excellent — this is a really good grammar question! 🌟

Let’s compare **while** and **when**, because they both talk about *time*, but they’re used a little differently.

## 🕒 1. **Basic meanings**

| Word      | Meaning                        | Focus                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **while** | “during the time that…”（在……期间） | Emphasizes *duration* (how long something happens) |
| **when**  | “at the time that…”（当……时）      | Emphasizes a *specific moment* or *event*          |

---

## 💡 2. **Examples**

### ✅ **while** → focuses on **a longer action happening**

* **I was reading while he was watching TV.**
  （我在读书的时候，他在看电视。）
  → two long actions happening *at the same time*.

* **She fell asleep while listening to music.**
  → “listening to music” took some time.

---

### ✅ **when** → focuses on **a specific time or event**

* **I was reading when he came in.**
  （我在读书时，他进来了。）
  → “he came in” happened once — a short event.

* **When I was a child, I liked ice cream.**
  → talking about *a time period* in life.

## ⚙️ 3. **Grammar pattern**

| Word      | Common structure               | Example                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **while** | while + continuous verb (-ing) | *while reading, while working*       |
| **when**  | when + clause (subject + verb) | *when I was young, when she arrived* |

## 🧠 4. **Quick rule of thumb**

| Use **while**                            | Use **when**                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Two long actions happen at the same time | A short action interrupts a longer one |
| Emphasize *duration*                     | Emphasize *moment*                     |
| *While I was cooking, he was cleaning.*  | *I was cooking when he arrived.*       |

## ✨ 5. Examples comparing both

* **While** I was doing my homework, **my phone rang.**
  → the phone rang *during* the homework.
* **When** my phone rang, I stopped doing my homework.
  → focuses on the *moment* of ringing.

✅ So:

* Use **while** for *during the time something happens*
* Use **when** for *at the moment something happens*
