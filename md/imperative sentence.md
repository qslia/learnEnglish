Great question! 👏

In the sentence **“Write down the answers in your notebook.”**, there is actually **no visible subject** — but the **subject is implied**.

---

### 💡 Explanation:

This sentence is an **imperative sentence** (祈使句), which is used to give an order or instruction.
In English imperatives, the subject **“you”** is usually **omitted**.

So the **full form** would be:
👉 **(You) write down the answers in your notebook.**

---

### ✅ Therefore:

* **Subject (implied):** *you*
* **Predicate (verb phrase):** *write down the answers in your notebook*

---

### 🌟 Similar examples:

* *(You)* **Sit down.**
* *(You)* **Close the door.**
* *(You)* **Do your homework.**

The subject “you” isn’t written, but it’s understood.

Would you like me to show you how to find the subject in other kinds of sentences (like questions or passive ones)?
