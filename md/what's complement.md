**补足语** in English is called a **complement** — more specifically here, an **object complement**.

### What is a complement?

A **complement** is a word or phrase that **gives more information about another word** and makes the meaning complete.

### In your sentence:

> **I like listening to birds singing.**

* **birds** = object
* **singing** = **object complement**

👉 **singing** tells us **what the birds are doing**.
Without it, the sentence would feel incomplete in meaning.

### Simple definition (exam-friendly):

> **An object complement describes or completes the meaning of the object.**

### Common pattern:

* **see / hear / notice + object + doing**

  * *I hear birds **singing***.
* **make / let / call + object + complement**

  * *They made me **happy***.

### One-line memory tip 🧠

> **If a word explains the object, it’s a complement.**

If you want, I can also explain the difference between **object**, **complement**, and **modifier** in one tiny chart 👍
