### 🩺 **1. “Stay healthy” ✅ (Correct)**

❌ “Stay health” → incorrect

**Why:**

* The verb **stay** is a **linking verb**, and linking verbs are followed by **adjectives**, not nouns.
* **Healthy** is an adjective.
* **Health** is a noun.

✅ **Examples:**

* **Stay healthy!** (= Remain in good health.)
* **I try to stay healthy by eating vegetables and exercising.**

---

### 💪 **2. “Keep healthy” ✅ (Correct)**

❌ “Keep health” → unnatural or incorrect in most cases

**Why:**

* **Keep** can be followed by an **adjective** to mean “remain in that state.”
* So **keep healthy** means “remain healthy.”
* You can say **keep your health**, but it’s less common and sounds more formal.

✅ **Examples:**

* **You should keep healthy by sleeping well.**
* **Take care and keep healthy!**

Let’s explain **what a linking verb** is in simple, clear English 👇

---

### 💡 **Definition**

A **linking verb** is a verb that **doesn’t show an action** — instead, it **connects** (or *links*) the **subject** of a sentence to more information about it.

That information usually describes **what the subject is** or **what the subject is like**.

---

### 🧩 **Example:**

> **She is a teacher.**
> Here,

* **She** = subject
* **is** = linking verb
* **a teacher** = tells us *what she is*

The verb **is** doesn’t show an action — it just links the subject (*she*) with its description (*a teacher*).

---

### 📘 **Common Linking Verbs**

The most common one is **be** (am, is, are, was, were).
But there are others too:

| Linking Verb          | Example Sentence             | Meaning                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **be**                | She **is** happy.            | describes a state             |
| **seem**              | He **seems** tired.          | shows appearance              |
| **look**              | You **look** great today.    | appearance                    |
| **feel**              | I **feel** cold.             | shows state or emotion        |
| **sound**             | That **sounds** interesting. | describes how something seems |
| **taste**             | The soup **tastes** good.    | describes flavor              |
| **smell**             | The flowers **smell** nice.  | describes smell               |
| **become**            | He **became** a doctor.      | shows change of state         |
| **get / grow / turn** | She **got** angry.           | also show change of state     |

---

### ⚙️ **How to test a linking verb**

Try replacing the verb with **is / are / was / were**.
If the sentence still makes sense, it’s probably a **linking verb**.

✅ Example:

* The soup **tastes** good → The soup **is** good. (✔ still makes sense)
  So “tastes” is a linking verb here.

❌ Example:

* She **runs** fast → She **is** fast. (❌ changes meaning)
  So “runs” is an **action verb**, not linking.

---

### 🧠 **In short:**

> A **linking verb** = connects the subject to a description, not an action.
