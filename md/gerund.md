Excellent question! 👏 Let’s break it down clearly and simply.

### 💡 1. What a gerund is

A **gerund** is the **–ing** form of a verb that functions **like a noun**.
For example:

* *reading*
* *swimming*
* *studying*

Although they look like verbs, gerunds **act as nouns** in sentences.

### 💬 2. Why a gerund can be a subject

Every sentence needs a **subject**, and a **subject must be a noun (or noun-like)**.
Since a **gerund functions as a noun**, it **can serve as the subject** of a sentence.

🧩 Example:

* **Reading helps you learn.**
  → Here, *Reading* is the subject.
  It answers the question “What helps you learn?” → “Reading.”

* **Swimming is fun.**
  → *Swimming* is what is fun.
  So *Swimming* = subject.

* **Remembering it is important.**
  → *Remembering it* = the thing that is important → subject.

### ⚙️ 3. Grammar logic

👉 In grammar terms:

* Verbs show actions.
* Nouns name things.
* Gerunds turn actions into “things” (concepts).

So when you say:

> **Reading is fun**,
> you are really saying:
> **The act of reading is fun.**

That’s why gerunds can be subjects — they represent **activities** or **concepts**, which behave like **nouns** grammatically.

### 🧠 4. Compare:

| Type | Example             | Function                               |
| ---- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Verb | I **read** books.   | shows action                           |
| Noun | **Reading** is fun. | names the action — becomes the subject |

Would you like me to show you how gerunds can also work as **objects** or **after prepositions** (not just subjects)?



✅ Yes — your sentence **“Why can gerund be subject?”** is understandable, but it’s not grammatically perfect.

Here’s how to make it **natural and correct** 👇

### ✅ Correct versions:

1. **Why can a gerund be a subject?** ✅
2. **Why can gerunds be subjects?** ✅ (plural, more general)

---

### 💡 Explanation:

* In English, **singular countable nouns** (like *gerund* or *subject*) need an **article (a/an/the)** when used in general statements.
  → So you must say **a gerund**, not just **gerund**.
* Also, since you’re talking about grammar rules in general, the **plural form** (*gerunds / subjects*) is often more natural.
