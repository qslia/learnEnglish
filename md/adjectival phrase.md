### Adjectival Phrases Used as Post-Modifiers (Post-Positioned Modifiers)

In English, an **adjectival phrase** can be used as a **post-modifier** (also called a **post-positioned attributive**) to describe a noun. This means the adjectival phrase **comes after the noun it modifies**, not before it.

### 1️⃣ What is a post-modifier?

A **post-modifier** is a word, phrase, or clause that gives additional information about a noun **after the noun appears**.

Example:

* **southern provinces rich in rivers and lakes**

Here, **rich in rivers and lakes** is an adjectival phrase modifying **provinces**.

---

### 2️⃣ Why is it placed after the noun?

In English, **single adjectives** usually come **before** a noun:

* a **beautiful** city

But when the adjective is expanded into a **phrase** (often with complements like prepositional phrases), it is usually placed **after** the noun for clarity and natural word order.

Compare:

* ❌ a **rich in rivers and lakes** province
* ✅ a province **rich in rivers and lakes**

---

### 3️⃣ Relationship to relative clauses

Many adjectival phrases used as post-modifiers can be understood as **reduced relative clauses**.

Example:

* provinces **rich in rivers and lakes**
  ≈ provinces **which are rich in rivers and lakes**

The relative pronoun (*which are*) is omitted, leaving a concise adjectival phrase.

### 4️⃣ Common patterns

Adjectival phrases often begin with:

* **rich in** (rich in resources)
* **famous for** (cities famous for history)
* **full of** (a room full of people)
* **known for** (a country known for innovation)

Examples:

* students **eager to learn**
* regions **abundant in minerals**
* a book **useful for beginners**

### 5️⃣ Function in sentences

Adjectival phrases used as post-modifiers:

* add detailed description
* make writing more concise and formal
* are common in academic, descriptive, and exam writing

---

### 6️⃣ Summary

An **adjectival phrase used as a post-modifier** is placed **after a noun** to describe it, often replacing a full relative clause. This structure is especially common when the adjective has complements or modifiers of its own.
